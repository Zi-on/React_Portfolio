      <p>I am a Web Developer who is looking to learn anything & everything coding/programming related. I am currently enrolled in a UTSA coding bootcamp & will be a certified full stack web developer by October of 2021. Through my experience with this bootcamp me & two fellow class mates created a crypto currency news website that grabs data from apis to fill the page with crypto stock information as well as news articles pertaining to the crypto selected. I have found myself prevailing in back end functionality & Java-scripting.
